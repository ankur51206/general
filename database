General benifits of using metrics and logs.

- A reduction in the time and resources spent hunting down hidden issues in the database and IT infrastructure.
- Ability for troubleshoot performance problems on a proactive basis to application development process.
- We can get top Insights into whether and how performance could be improved, such as - performance query, compute power insights etc.
- Reactive monitoring might be employed for performance troubleshooting, optimising etc..

-------Below are the metrics that can help in application development process to manage databases---------

Queries: To ensure a high level of overall performance, itâ€™s important to monitor the performance of the queries themselves. 

Capacity/Compute issues: Database issues can be caused by issues with the hardware, like lagging CPU speed or insufficient CPUs, slow disks, misconfigured disks, full disks, and lack of memory.

Measure throughput: Measuring and comparing throughput means staying on top of throughput metrics, like the number of connections per second and replication latency.

Monitor database logs: Database logs are key to proactive monitoring, because they contain critical information.
